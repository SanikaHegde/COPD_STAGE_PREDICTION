# 🫁 Multimodal Deep Learning Framework for Early COPD Prediction & Severity Stage Classification

## 📌 Overview  
This project implements a **dual Deep Learning–based system** designed for early diagnosis and accurate staging of **Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)**.  
Unlike traditional approaches that rely only on spirometry or binary classification of lung sounds, this framework **combines two complementary data sources**:

- 📊 **Structured spirometry & demographic data (FEV1, FVC, Age, BMI, Smoking History)**  
- 🎧 **Respiratory audio signals converted into MFCC features**

By integrating both modalities, the system achieves **98.19% accuracy** and **AUC = 0.99**, significantly outperforming single-modality baselines :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}.

  - **CNN–LSTM** for COPD vs Non-COPD lung sound classification  
- MFCC-based feature extraction for respiratory sounds  
- Automated preprocessing pipelines  
- Flask-based lightweight web deployment  
- Real-time, non-invasive respiratory assessment
